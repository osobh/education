## An Experiment:

For the next hour I want you to think about computer programing. Think about __everything you know about computer programming__.

>For 30 minutes, write a short summary of three concepts, technologies, principles, or things related to computer programing that you understand __very well__.


Write Something, and don't forget:

```js
/**
 * Practice using a markdown editor, like Mou, or MacDown to practice
 * writing readme.md files for github. Follow this rule: 
*/
function useCodeBlocks() {
	if(itsCode) {
		return true;
	}

	return false;
}
```

#### Take a short break, then:

> For 15 minutes, research one concept that is "on your horizon". Something you *almost* understand. 
> 
> Maybe this is something you understand in concept, but can't implement; Or code that has a bug, but you're not sure why; Or maybe it's a topic you've read about, but don't fully understand. 
> 
> Practice using Google. Favor answers from reputable sources. First try to find something *fairly academic*: official documentation, wikipedia, StackOverflow (if there are __several__ upvotes). Skim it -- you're looking for new "keywords" for a second search query, and a trustworthy reference.
> 
>  Once you've found a reference and learned some new keywords search again, but add "tutorial" or "example" to your search query. Try rewriting your search terms using the new keywords if you aren't finding what you need.  
> 
> This time favor things like: blog posts and walkthroughs, especially ones with code examples. 

### Now, write a similar summary for this topic:

> Take 15 minutes and write a summary of the topic.

### On Monday You Will Read Your Classmates' Work

> For at least 10 minutes, scan your classmates fork's of this repo. Try to find some overlapping topics: things someone else wrote about that you also wrote about. Find 2 or 3 overlapping topics within your classmates work. 
> 
> Read them with a critical eye -- what you've written should be considered a rough draft. Take notes, focusing on two things: questions you have, and suggestions for improvement. 

### Finally,

> Deliver our feedback in person! Have a conversation about what you wrote, and topics you found interesting. Chat in groups if you like. Just discuss what you wrote and learned with your classmates.
