# How To:

###To start:

Fork this repo, then clone your fork. In your local repository (the clone of your fork) set the remote 'upstream' to this repo:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:osobh/education.git
```

###Every day:

First: get the new code from the upstream:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Second: Work on the warmup for the day. 

Third: when you've completed the warmup push your work to your fork

```
git push origin master
```
