# In this warmup, you'll be given an integer of range 0 <= x <= 99 
# and have to return that number spelt out in English. A few examples:

# nameThatNumber(4)   // returns "four"
# nameThatNumber(19)  // returns "nineteen"
# nameThatNumber(99)  // returns "ninety nine"
# Words should be seperated by only spaces and not hyphens. 
# No need to validate parameters, they will always be in the 
# range [0, 99]. Make sure that the returned String has no 
# leading of trailing spaces. Good luck!
