/*
This time we want to write calculations using 
functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

seven(times(five())); // must return 35
four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
Requirements:

There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
There must be a function for each of the following 
mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby)
Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
The most outer function represents the left operand, 
the most inner function represents the right operand
