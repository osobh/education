# Intro to Data Structures

A [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently. The key word here is "efficiently". At the end of the day, we are only interested in data structures that are efficient (we will discuss how we measure efficiency later).

## Objectives

* Learn the concepts behind data structures and algorithms
* Understand how to implement a particular data structure (or algorithm) in the language of your choice
* Understand more about how computers work and what goes on behind the scenes, especially with memory

> Get excited as this is a really cool part of computer science!

With the definition and objectives out of the way, let's think about a data structure we have used since the beginning of our coding journey -  an array? An array is a very simple data structure, but what does it do well? What does it not do well? Start [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8423493/what-is-the-performance-of-objects-arrays-in-javascript-specifically-for-googl).

## How should you decide which DS to use?

Some questions you have to ask and decisions you have to make are:

- What needs to be stored?
- What are the cost of operations?
- What is the potential memory usage?
- What is the ease of implementation (not always the best question...)?

## Common data structures
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs

Once again, the most important takeaway you can get from these lessons is an understanding of just __what__ these data structures are. This is called [Abstract Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT). When learning about a data structure, the more important thing to remember is that you want to strive to gain an understanding of just __WHAT__ it is before you even think about how to implement one.

The following lessons on data structures will focus mostly on the definition, application and value. The implementation will be left up to you!
