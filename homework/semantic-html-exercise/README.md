# Semantic Markup Exercise

Fork and clone this repository.

`index.html` contains a file that was marked up exclusively with `<div>` tags. Examine the content, and rewrite it using semantic markup. Then check your improved markup for errors with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

When you're done, send a PR with your changes to this repository.
