# Learn By Doing: Error Handeling in JavaScript

Today we're going to walk through a series of short exercises together as a class in order to learn about errors and error handling in JavaScript.

### Learning Objectives, by the end of this you should be able to:

* Define the term "Error" as it relates to javascript.
* Read a "Stack Trace" to extract the following information:
	* The line of code where the error occured.
	* The type of error that occured.
	* What path the code traveled to get to that line.
* Use a try/catch bock to handle expected errors.
* Throw a custom error.
