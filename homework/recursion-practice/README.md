# Brief Recursion Practice

In order to practice the concept of recursion, we're going to write three short recursive functions. These functions are declared in scripts.js, you should finish implementing them!

* Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and prints the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall, starting with the number passed to the function.
* Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and returns the fibonacci value of that position. The fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... So fib(4) should return 5 and fib(5) should return 8.
* Define a recursive function that returns true if a string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

### Verify Your Solution:

There are tests for fibonacci and isPalindrome. You'll have to verify 99 bottles by looking at your console output. In order to get the tests running, you'll need to:

```
npm install chai
```

Then run them with:

```
mocha
```

### Bonus!

Once you've finished the recursive versions, try implementing an iterative solution for each. Think about which do you prefer in each case? 

## When you're done, show one of the instructors!
