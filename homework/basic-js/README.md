# Javascript Fundamentals Part I

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. In the root directory of this folder, run `npm install`
1. Add the necessary code in `script.js` for each function
2. Run `npm test` to run the tests 
2. Once the tests pass you are all done!

## Problems

1. Define a function called `sum` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
1. Define a function called `isEqual` that takes two arguments and returns a boolean. Return true if the two arguments are equal and return false if they are not.
1. Define a function called `isEven` that takes an arbitrary whole number as an argument and return a boolean. Return true if the number is even and false if it is not.
1. Define a function called `isDivisible` that takes two arguments and returns a boolean. Return true if the first argument is divisible by the second; otherwise, return false.
1. Define a function called `discountPercentage` that returns the total discount ($), given the original amount and discount percentage (as arguments). Return a warning that says "please enter a number between 0 and 100" if the discount amount is greater than 100 or less that 0 percent.
1. Define a function called `isVowel` that takes a letter and returns true if the letter is a vowel, and false if the letter is a consonant. (Treat 'y' as a consonant)
1. Write code that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
1. Define a function called `biggestOfThree` which takes three numbers as arguments, and returns the largest one.
1. **Bonus**: Write a function that will estimate your federal income taxes. The function should take just one input: your salary (or future salary, once you graduate!). The link below has information on how federal income taxes are calculated:
