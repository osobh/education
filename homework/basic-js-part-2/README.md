# Javascript Fundamentals Part II

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. In the root directory of this folder, run `npm install`
1. Add the necessary code in `script.js` for each function
2. Run `npm test` to run the tests 
2. Once the tests pass you are all done!

## Problems

1. Complete the 'Bean Counting' exercise from Chapter 3 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
1. Complete the 'Sum of a Range' exercise from Chapter 4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)
1. Complete the 'Reversing an Array' exercise from Chapter 4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)
1. Create an `isPalindrome()` function which takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value: `true` if the string is a palindrome, and `false` if not. E.g. `isPalindrome("bob")` should return `true`, but `isPalindrome("robert")` should return `false`. **Bonus** Write the function so that it ignores capitalization of letters. **Bonus bonus** Write the function so that it also ignores whitespaces and punctuation (so that "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" would be classified as a palindrome). 
1. A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is one that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Write a function `isPrime` which takes a single input, a whole number, and returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.
2. Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
3. Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and an number i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.
4. Write a function `createObject` that takes in two arguments and returns an object with the first argument as the key in the object and the second as the value
5. Write a function `numberObject` which takes in a number and returns an object with the keys being all the numbers up to the first argument and the values being the numbers up to the first argument times 5. (numberObject(4) returns `{0:0,1:5,2:10,3:15}`)
5. Write a function `reverseString` which takes a string and returns the string reversed ("awesome" becomes "emosewa")
5. Write a function called `youngestPerson` that takes an array of objects with names as keys and ages as values (e.g., [{'Tom': 22, 'Jane': 46}]), and then returns the name of the youngest living person.
6. Write a function called `keys` that takes an object and returns an array with all of the keys in the object.
