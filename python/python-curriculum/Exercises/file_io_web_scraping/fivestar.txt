 Review: Friendly staff +Food +Ambiance +Beer selection + What a happy accidental find! I googled "SF Mac and cheese" after a disappointing Mac and cheese experience around the corner. Once you have a Mac and cheese craving, it's hard to stifle without satisfaction! Fat Angel popped up in an article listing where you find the best Mac and cheese in SF. They were not wrong!!! Omg! Not to mention the friendly staff and amazing beer selection will have me coming back here often now that I've found it.

 Review: Pleasantly surprised. Seriously. Sausage flat-bread was really, really tasty. Granted I was famished, but that's neither here nor there. Crust was thin, yet spongy enough to provide a good mouth-feel. Toppings were excellente.Beer selection had some stuff I don't normally see. YMMV. I'm not really into wine, but everyone else seemed to be. That's gotta count for something, right?We ended up sitting outside which was good for people watching. It can get pretty loud inside, though. Just a fair warning.Yes, yes, I'll go back. And I'll tell all my friends. Even write to my congressperson and so on. But don't take MY word for it!

 Review: This place is awesome. Â The Mac and cheese, sliders, and pot pie are amazing. The atmosphere is great. The selection of beer is dizzying ( there's five pages frontand back, just for the beer menu). The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Jessica behind the bar is great!! Definitely coming back

 Review: Okay, this is my 4th meal of that crazy Sunday. I am pretty positive that I wasn't even hungry until I walked into this restaurant..The lighting was pretty dim. The waitress was very patient regarding all of the questions about beer my friends threw at her. We had their signature chicken pot pie.. Have to say even better than my grandma's!! (I know!! Ouch!! Sorry granny!!!) the puff pastry was buttery and crusty!! The filling has thick and flavorful. (Somehow I felt the potatoes were a bit undercooked..hmm..) And the kale truffle flatbread was phenomenal, maybe I have bias on anything truffle..@.@.. Smoked trout salad is another item I enjoyed a lot. The horseradish vinaigrette was light, but the salad was tossed so well, every single bite will pick up all the flavors. And their Mac n Cheese.. Hmmmm... Spicy!! I am not a fan of Mac n cheese.. But couldn't help having couple of scoops here!!Love this place! Recommend!!

 Review: This place is a hidden gem! My friend and I stumbled upon this place and we were looking for a place to grab happy hour, and I am so glad we ended up here!The space is small and intimate, but in a nice and cozy way. Not in a cramped, overcrowded way. It has an upscale, but easy-going feel to it and I love the look inside. It feels like a vintage gastropub. We sat at the bar and were just planning on having a simple glass of wine and some olives to munch on....but we ended up being there for over 3 hours!!! Our bartender was so friendly and welcoming. We drank wine all night and she suggested a flatbread from their menu that we NEVER would have considered but it was amazing! The flatbread we got was roasted red grape, walnut & prosciutto with gorgonzola. Soooo good! The flavors came together so well and it was perfect to have with wine.This is the perfect place to come to for some wine and cheese. Their flatbreads are delicious and perfect for sharing. And the atmosphere is so intimate and cozy. Cannot wait to come back.

 Review: Great place for date night! Large wine and beer selection, and delicious food!I'm a sucker for chicken pot pie, so I knew I had to order it.The pot pie filling was probably the best pot pie filling I've ever had. Super savory without being too salty. It was amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the puff pastry crust, but it was still good.The sliders were good too. Will be back!

 Review: We came here on a Saturday night about 6pm and it was still about a half hour wait to seat five of us. It's a much smaller restaurant (seats maybe 30 people) and has an intimate vibe. We saw quite a few dates while we were there. Aside from the restaurant, there is also a bar located at the front if you just want to stop by for a drink or two.Food (5/5) To be completely honest, the sausage, tomato, and arugula flatbread that I ordered was probably one of the best flatbread that I have ever tasted. It had a thin crust and was topped with delicious spicy sausage. I should also mention that the flatbread is a very generous portion and I was able to take half of it home for tomorrow's breakfast (SCORE!). My friends also really loved the sliders, chicken pot pie, and mac and cheese.Drinks (4/5) The drink menu is quite large, but I was surprised that it cost me $13 for a 12oz bottled beer...I mean I love me some good beer but that is a hefty price for something I can buy in the store.Overall I'd say the food was awesome and the beer was great. They've got wine, beer, and something for everyone.
