 Review: Friendly staff +Food +Ambiance +Beer selection + What a happy accidental find! I googled "SF Mac and cheese" after a disappointing Mac and cheese experience around the corner. Once you have a Mac and cheese craving, it's hard to stifle without satisfaction! Fat Angel popped up in an article listing where you find the best Mac and cheese in SF. They were not wrong!!! Omg! Not to mention the friendly staff and amazing beer selection will have me coming back here often now that I've found it.

 Review: Great bartenders and the atmosphere is great. It's kinda small but a great date spot too. They have happy hour from M-F 4:30-6PM. I believe for bottle of wine its about $4 dollars off, 1$ off draft, and $2 off flat bread. I've heard their chicken pot pie was good but wasn't able to try it. The cheese and meat plate was really good too. Can't go wrong with that.

 Review: Fat Angel is a relaxed-yet-cool wine bar/gastropub, perfect for a quick drink or a few solid bites. The boy and I dropped by before a nearby dinner last weekend, and had a really great time.THE HIGHLIGHTS.+ Friendly, helpful staff+ Quality, hand-mixed cocktails (seriously)+ Outrageously awesome selection of local beers and wines+ Very cool, trendy interiors (loved sitting at the marble bar!)I can't speak for the food, but there were many happy customers noshing away behind us.One note (unrelated to Fat Angel) - if you're a dog owner, don't just tie up your overly dependent black Labrador Retriever in front of the place, and leave it there while it's RAINING. Just because it has a water bowl doesn't make you a good pet owner. Either sit outside with your pet or leave it at home, don't be negligent because you want to get a drink.

 Review: I had some time to kill before dinner, so I met up some friends at Fat Angel for a drink. I got there a little before 6pm, so I was able to grab some seats at the bar. It was Thursday, February 25th.*Stones throw's pimm's cup: housemade pimm's & ginger beer ($9)*Crement de loire: domaine claude branger 'eclipse' muscadet, france ($13 glass)*Lambrusco grasparossa: barbolini 'lancillotto' castelvetro, italy ($9 glass)I wanted a glass of bubbly so I got the crement de loire. My girlfriend got the glass of lambrusco. It was a bubbly red. As a fan of red wine, I ended up liking her glass more. Another friend joined us and he got the pimm's cup. It was refreshing, but it was a little too sweet for me.I'd love to come back for their food. I was actually tempted to order something to snack on while we were drinking, but I restrained since we were going to dinner.Great place for wine. I will definitely be back to try their food.

 Review: Nice place for a drink after work. Very unassuming and chill place. Had a glass of Merlot and let's be honest....wine makes everything better. Right on fat angel.

 Review: Pleasantly surprised. Seriously. Sausage flat-bread was really, really tasty. Granted I was famished, but that's neither here nor there. Crust was thin, yet spongy enough to provide a good mouth-feel. Toppings were excellente.Beer selection had some stuff I don't normally see. YMMV. I'm not really into wine, but everyone else seemed to be. That's gotta count for something, right?We ended up sitting outside which was good for people watching. It can get pretty loud inside, though. Just a fair warning.Yes, yes, I'll go back. And I'll tell all my friends. Even write to my congressperson and so on. But don't take MY word for it!

 Review: This place is awesome.  The Mac and cheese, sliders, and pot pie are amazing. The atmosphere is great. The selection of beer is dizzying ( there's five pages frontand back, just for the beer menu). The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Jessica behind the bar is great!! Definitely coming back

 Review: Okay, this is my 4th meal of that crazy Sunday. I am pretty positive that I wasn't even hungry until I walked into this restaurant..The lighting was pretty dim. The waitress was very patient regarding all of the questions about beer my friends threw at her. We had their signature chicken pot pie.. Have to say even better than my grandma's!! (I know!! Ouch!! Sorry granny!!!) the puff pastry was buttery and crusty!! The filling has thick and flavorful. (Somehow I felt the potatoes were a bit undercooked..hmm..) And the kale truffle flatbread was phenomenal, maybe I have bias on anything truffle..@.@.. Smoked trout salad is another item I enjoyed a lot. The horseradish vinaigrette was light, but the salad was tossed so well, every single bite will pick up all the flavors. And their Mac n Cheese.. Hmmmm... Spicy!! I am not a fan of Mac n cheese.. But couldn't help having couple of scoops here!!Love this place! Recommend!!

 Review: This place is a hidden gem! My friend and I stumbled upon this place and we were looking for a place to grab happy hour, and I am so glad we ended up here!The space is small and intimate, but in a nice and cozy way. Not in a cramped, overcrowded way. It has an upscale, but easy-going feel to it and I love the look inside. It feels like a vintage gastropub. We sat at the bar and were just planning on having a simple glass of wine and some olives to munch on....but we ended up being there for over 3 hours!!! Our bartender was so friendly and welcoming. We drank wine all night and she suggested a flatbread from their menu that we NEVER would have considered but it was amazing! The flatbread we got was roasted red grape, walnut & prosciutto with gorgonzola. Soooo good! The flavors came together so well and it was perfect to have with wine.This is the perfect place to come to for some wine and cheese. Their flatbreads are delicious and perfect for sharing. And the atmosphere is so intimate and cozy. Cannot wait to come back.

 Review: I love, love, love Fat Angel. It is a hidden (or not so hidden) gem of San Francisco. It is right off of Fillmore, it is a great spot if you are in the neighborhood. I've been going for about four years, and every time I go I find another great menu item. Mind you the menu is only one page (we aren't talking Cheesecake Factory selections) so hard to believe that I haven't tried it all. But on my last visit I discovered the Chicken Pot Pie. Divine! It may have been my first time trying it, but it certainly won't be my last. It is an open bowl of Chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and the perfect amount of gravy and spices with a nice layer of buttery, flakey crust on the bottom and backed to perfection on the top. Man, I want to go back today just to try it again. It is almost sweet (in a good way) so I do recommend sprinkling with salt and pepper. They always have a kick bootie beer selection. And definitely keep them on the radar during sf beer week. Every evening they have a different delicious offering. I sampled five great Paradox beers and on another night 5 Bruery beers poured from bottles. (They had fifteen hard to find beers to choose from, so I had to narrow it down to one sample of five.)Our fall back food options have always been the bread with flavored butters. The most recent flavors were Bernaise, Chive, Chili, Maple Bacon and Molasses. You can try one for $5.50, three for $15 or all five for I think $25. That is a lot of butter, but I did feel compelled to try them all once and take home the left overs. This last time the Bernaise butter was my favorite. Delish.We also love their flatbreads, toppings change seasonally. Most recently we tried the butternut squash and kale. Perfect!And the mac n cheese, is great. Has a tangy hardier taste with the perfect amount of sauce to crunch ratio.Sometimes the prices can get a little steep if you don't pay attention when ordering, you think it may be a quick bite of food and a beer from your local gastropub, and next thing you know your tab is $90. But you can't blame them for having too many awesome things to order! I would like to have cold ice water, luke warm water is the worst. And a few veggie sides and sweet options. But this place is a great go to spot.

 Review: Great place for date night! Large wine and beer selection, and delicious food!I'm a sucker for chicken pot pie, so I knew I had to order it.The pot pie filling was probably the best pot pie filling I've ever had. Super savory without being too salty. It was amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the puff pastry crust, but it was still good.The sliders were good too. Will be back!

 Review: Molasses brown sugar butter?  Yes, please.  Creamy, delicious spicy mac n cheese?  I really shouldn't, but hey, I can start my diet tomorrow... Sliders?  Well, only if they're good (and yes, they are!).  In summary: truly satisfying comfort food!  Lengthy selection of beer (there's gotta be something for everyone in this drink menu). Friendly staff. Outdoor tables. Good times.

 Review: We came here on a Saturday night about 6pm and it was still about a half hour wait to seat five of us. It's a much smaller restaurant (seats maybe 30 people) and has an intimate vibe. We saw quite a few dates while we were there. Aside from the restaurant, there is also a bar located at the front if you just want to stop by for a drink or two.Food (5/5) To be completely honest, the sausage, tomato, and arugula flatbread that I ordered was probably one of the best flatbread that I have ever tasted. It had a thin crust and was topped with delicious spicy sausage. I should also mention that the flatbread is a very generous portion and I was able to take half of it home for tomorrow's breakfast (SCORE!). My friends also really loved the sliders, chicken pot pie, and mac and cheese.Drinks (4/5) The drink menu is quite large, but I was surprised that it cost me $13 for a 12oz bottled beer...I mean I love me some good beer but that is a hefty price for something I can buy in the store.Overall I'd say the food was awesome and the beer was great. They've got wine, beer, and something for everyone.

 Review: So excited that I got to make an excuse to go out to the Filmore to explore! We ended up at Fat Angel because of the great reviews and their interesting menu.This place is pretty small and I don't know what the crowds are like on the weekends, but on a Monday night there was still a wait around 8PM.  I started out with the local cider from San Bruno. It was a typical, crisp cider but for some reason it was really really good! Definitely recommend it if you like ciders! For food, we got the pretzel to start. The cheese and mustard dipping sauces that came out with the pretzel were amazing; I wish I could get some to take home! The pretzel was served warm and it was a great starter to pair with our drinks. For the main courses, we got the asparagus flatbread and the spicy mac n cheese. Both were pretty good! The asparagus was very fresh and the kalamata olives added a nice tangy touch to the flatbread. The mac n cheese was a little spicy so beware! But it was still very creamy and delicious :) I want to come back again for happy hour to explore their tremendous drinks menu and maybe try some of their cheese plates!

 Review: Off the beaten path in western addition, you have Fat Angel.Small & charming, it's a great neighborhood spot for a quick meal & some vino.  Perfect for a date or a quiet night out w your peeps.Props for the cheese plate.  It was generous & included nuts & honey.  I've gone in early.  And I've gone in late.  When I went in early, it went from nearly empty to completely full in seemingly no time at all.  It was totally tame when I went in towards the end of the night, though.  FYI.4 stars.

 Review: Good Wine, good food with good portions. Couldn't ask for more.  The restaurant itself is on the smaller end but when I went around 8pm on a weekday we did not have to wait to get seated.  Not sure how crowded it gets at busier times.  Their salads are delicious and come in a great portion size.  We ordered a flatbread and the chicken pot pie and all was good. The meals are full of flavor so you'll need water and wine ;) to wash it all down!

 Review: I really enjoyed having drinks & dinner at Fat Angel! I had been wanting to go for a while.The neighborhood where it's located is lively, the decor cozy, the staff friendly (they make you feel like you're at home!) and the drinks menu is so long! There are so many kinds of beers and wines from different parts of the world. There's definitely a bit of everything of everyone!I had the Pinot Gris from Oregon and really enjoyed it. My friends had red wines from pitchers and huge German beers they all liked.Between 4 people, we shared a the spicy sausage flatbread (huge, like a squared pizza basically & definitely good for 4!), the spicy mac & cheese (best mac & cheese I've had in a while!), 2 big soft pretzels and a huge Kale salad. The salads are realllllly huge and impossible to eat by yourself even if you tried :-D I love greens, so I was happy!I loved the atmosphere, we will be back!

 Review: Boyfriend and I came here on St. Patty's for dinner. Supposedly was going to meet up with friends, but they all kinda flaked out last min. So ended up being a date night for us two. No complains necessarily. :)Fat Angel is a pretty tiny place, but we got seated pretty fast once we confirmed that it was just going to be the two of us. We sat next to the window side by side where we can do people watching. We ordered:Sliders - yummy!Mac&Cheese- pretty good.Honey butter w/ bread- nom!Meat & cheese- pretty good. Bf seemed to liked it. 2 different dessert wines were pretty strong.Overall it was pretty good. Service was pretty friendly & fast.  There was an odd thing that happened right before we left. This dude came up to us wanting a napkin. Then we see him giving to another dude outside. Pretty weird.

 Review: Holy smokes, the food here is SO darn delicious. Best chicken pot pie and flatbread I've ever had. Also, be sure to order some sweet wines toward the end of your dinner!The only reason why I'm giving this place a 4-star is because it can get incredibly loud toward dinner time / after work. I had to literally yell across the table to tell my friend a story. In a way, it's a good thing because EVERYONE is there to chat and you won't have any awkward silences. It gets super busy around the bar as well. I would recommend getting a seat early if you can!
