# Terminal Exercises

Complete all of these exercises in a Python REPL

1. Create a list of a few of your friends.
2. Create a function named hi_friends that takes in a list as an argument, iterates over your list, and prints "Hi, [friend's name]!" to the console. Then, call the function to ensure it works properly.
3. Create a function named hi\_some\_friends that takes in a list and optionally begin, end, and step arguments. The defaults of these parameters should be the 0, the length of the list, and 1 respectively. The function will iterate over a slice of the list and say hi to each person in that slice.
4. Reverse your friends list on one line.
5. Add two friends to your list.
6. Remove a friend from the end of the list.
7. Add your best friend to the beginning of the list.
8. Oh no! They made you mad and you are no longer friends! Remove your best friend from the list.
9. Find the index of one of your friends.
10. Remove that friend from the list.
11. Create a tuple of the people in your family.
12. Try to add a cousin to your tuple.
13. Unpack your tuple into variables for each member of your family.
14. Create a dictionary with keys of the instructors first names and values of their last names.
15. Store a copy of your dictionary in a new variable.
16. Sadly, remove Elie and Matt from the original dictionary.
17. Check to make sure that Elie and Matt are still in the copied dictionary.
18. Now add Elie, Matt, Tim, and Janey to the original dictionary.
19. Create a set of all of the big cities in the world that you can think of. (Make sure there are a few from California and Canada)
20. Create a set of all of the big cities in America. 
21. Create a set of all of the big cities in California.
22. The California cities set should be a subset of both of the other sets. Check to make sure that is true.
23. Create a set of all of the big cities in Canada.
24. Check to make sure that the set of all big cities in the world are a superset of the union of the set of big American cities and the set of big Canadian cities.
25. Finally, find the big cities that are both in the California set and Canada set. (It should be the empty set)
